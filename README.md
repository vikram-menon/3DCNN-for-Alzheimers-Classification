# Alzheimers x AI

In this project, a 3DCNN was used to classify videos of blood flowing in the brain of mice. There are two files: datapreprocessing and the model. 
Preprocessing includes setting a frame limit, cropping the image, and removing the red circle.
The model attained a 70% training accuracy by utilizing a 3DCNN. 
The classified videos are used to help Alzheimer's researchers to find a cure for the disease.
